The chosen language is Python. For Python there are multiple choices for linter and some of those are linters that have packaged together many stand-alone linters. Example of these would be Pylama. Perhaps the most well known of the stand-alone linters is Pylint. For testing the application one could choose Pytest, which is one of the most popular testing frameworks for Python applications, and for acceptance testing Robot Framework would be very suitable. For building the application, some of the tools include Poetry, which is a very popular project manager, and PyBuilder. PyBuilder might have a steeper learning curve than Poetry, since many features like managing the dependencies in PyBuilder are plugin based, though that might make it more versatile for some cases. For CI there are multiple tools one can use. Many of these services offer Cloud based service as well as a self hosted one. Some examples of these are CircleCI and GitLab CI. The choice of tool depends on the need of the team. Some of the cloud services are pricey, and are thus not that suitable for small applications, but on the other hand self hosted CI tools can involve a lot of needless configuration. Many cloud based services also offer free tiers for their service, which are admittedly slow and thus more restrictive, but for small applications they can be very good. Also if privacy is of concern, self hosted application could be the best choice.
